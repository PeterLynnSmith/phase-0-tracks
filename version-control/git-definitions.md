# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

* Version control is how we work on something without risk of damaging it. We make a new version and then work on that new version, then we merge it with the original. It is useful becuase it keeps us from damaging something while allowing us to play with our own version of it.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

* A branch is how we create our own version of something, we use it as a fail-safe. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

* A commit is when we confirm that what we have added should be integrated to our branch. A good commit message is in the present tense and tells us exactly what was finalized when we made that commit.

* What is a merge conflict?

*A merge conflict is when we combine two files boot something overlapped so the two puzzle pieces couldn't match up.
