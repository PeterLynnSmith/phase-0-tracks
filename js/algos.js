//write a function that takes an array
//of words or phrases and returns the 
//longest word or phrase in the array. 
//So if we gave your function the array 
//of ["long phrase","longest phrase","longer phrase"], 
//it would return "longest phrase". This is a logical 
//reasoning challenge, so try to reason through this 
//based on what you already know, rather than Googling 
//the fanciest solution or looking up built-in sorting 
//functions. Note that "some string".length will do what you expect in JS.

// create a function that goes through a length of words 
// create a function that determines the length of a word

function printArray(array) {
	console.log(array);
}


printArray(["hello", "sup", "goodbye"])
